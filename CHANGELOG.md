# Changelog

## Beta 5

**Changes**
* Improve experience for users when they hit enter with no suggestion selected. The current test in the input will be geocoded and the map centered on the extent of all results. This behavior can be disabled by setting `allowMultipleResults` to `false`.
* Fix behavior of `useMapBounds` which was incorrect.
* Don't pass `bbox` with suggest. The suggest API doesn't use it.
* Increase `useMapBounds` default to `12`.

## Beta 4

**Breaking Changes**
* Esri Leaflet Geocoder now relies on the Esri Leaflet Core build, find out more on the [Esri Leaflet downloads page](http://esri.github.com/esri-leaflet/downloads).
* The callback signatures on `L.esri.Services.Geocoding`. The raw response is now the 3rd parameter and the second parameter is now a processed array of [Geocode Results](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder#geocode-results) or a[Reverse Geocode Results](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder#reverse-geocode-result) depending on the call.
* `L.esri.Services.Geocoding` no longer accepts the `outFields` parameter.

**Changes**
* Fix a display issues where the form would close but would not expand again. https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder/issues/33
* Now that `L.esri.Services.Geocoder` extends on `L.esri.Services.Service` you can pass teh `forStorage` flag with any call and authenticate. Listen for the `authenticationrequired` event and provide a token or pass a `token` option.
